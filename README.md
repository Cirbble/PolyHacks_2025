# PolyHacks_2025

This project is split into two major components:
The code for the backend AI and data gathering
And another part for the web app frontend

The backend is all the code that is not in the file "light_vibes_project"
and the frontend is everything in the file

For the backend,
API_CALLER_1.py gathers the data from the API
fix_the_vs.py and quicksort.py then format the data into a csv file
and then it is used as training data for the AI

To run the frontend,
first cd into light_vibes_project
then run npm install,
and then npm run dev
and connect to the local host
