------------------------
About the project (technical)
------------------------

This project is split into two major components:
The code for the backend AI and data gathering
And another part for the web app frontend

The backend is all the code that is not in the file "light_vibes_project"
and the frontend is everything in the file

--------------------------
How to run the project
--------------------------

For the backend,
API_CALLER_1.py gathers the data from the API
fix_the_vs.py and quicksort.py then format the data into a csv file
and then it is used as training data for the AI

To run the backend, you have to start the file app.py,
IT IS CRITICAL YOU DO THIS BEFORE STARTING THE SERVER
otherwise it won't work


To run the frontend,
first cd into light_vibes_project
then run npm install,
and then npm run dev
and connect to the local host
